# Sentiment-analysis-tweets-NLTK

A large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles, posts on social media, and search history. The process of analyzing natural language and making sense out of it falls under the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into a pre-defined sentiment.

In this project I will use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a commonly used NLP library in Python, to analyze textual data.

I will prepare a dataset of sample tweets from the NLTK package for NLP with different data cleaning methods. Once the dataset is ready for processing, I will train a model on pre-classified tweets and use the model to classify the sample tweets into negative and positives sentiments.
